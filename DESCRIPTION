Description: In assessing the generalizability of a statistical learning algorithm, it is vital to consider a variety of diverse, feature-rich datasets. In this package, we develop a simple interface to many common benchmark datasets, including the Penn Machine Learning Benchmarks Olson (2017) <arXiv:1703.00512>, allowing users to examine performance across many disparate contexts.
